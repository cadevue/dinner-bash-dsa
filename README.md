# About This Project ðŸ§±
This program is part of my Computer Science Study at Bandung Institute of Technology. The specific course related to this project is IF2110 Algorithm and Data Structure. The full specification of the project is available at the [docs folder](docs/Specification.pdf), although it is available in Indonesian Only.

This project was originally assigned at the 3rd semester, but I decided to redo the entire project (by February 2025) from scratch to improve the code quality and to make it more maintainable. It also useful as a refresher for me to understand the concept of basic data structure and its related algorithms.
