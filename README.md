<h1 align="center">Dinner Bash üë®‚Äçüç≥<br>A CLI Cooking Management Game</h1>

> This project is part of my CS202 Challenge. More details about it on [my website](https://cadevue.com)! (updated soon)

## Project Description 
A CLI program implemented in C about a cooking management game! Player can move inside a map and interact with the environment, such as buying ingredients and cooking food. This game has no win condition. This is just simulation that focus on implementation of basic data structure and algorithm, such as:

- **Static List** to store game configurations, such as foods and its recipes (loaded in the beginning of the game).
- **Matrix** to store the map of the game.
- **Priority Queue** (in dynamic manner with **linked list**) to store the player's inventory based on expiration date, and delivery queue based on its arrival time.
- **Tree** to store the recipes of the food.
- **Stack** to store the player's action history, with undo and redo feature.
- **Map** for algorithms in the game, such as checking whether the ingredients are available to cook a certain food.

> All data structures are implemented from scratch, without using library!

## Technology Used
The technologies used in this project are:
- **C** language the for game implementation
- **CMake** for the build system
- **GCC** as the compiler

## How to Run
### Prerequisites
- GCC Compiler
- CMake
- Makefiles

### Windows
1. Navigate to the project directory
2. Run `.\scripts\build.bat` to compile the program.
3. Run `.\scripts\run.bat` to run the program.

### Other Operating System (Manual Build)
1. Navigate to the project directory
2. Make build directory: `mkdir build`, then navigate to build directory `cd build`
3. Run `cmake ..` to generate the makefiles
4. Run `make` to compile the program
